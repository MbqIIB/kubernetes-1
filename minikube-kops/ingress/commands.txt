Its an alternative to external Loadbalancer and nodePorts

    # Ingress allows you to easily expose services that need to be accessible from outside to the cluster

# With ingress you can run your own ingress controller ( basically loadbalancer ) within the kubernetes cluster

# there are default ingress controller available, or you can write your own ingress controller

we can also setup rules based on hosts or paths

for example host-x goes to pod1

            host-y goes to pod2

and /api/v2 goes to a different pod
